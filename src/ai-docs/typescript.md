## TypeScript

- Use TypeScript
- Use `type` instead of `interface`
- Use `const` instead of `let`
- Do not use the class syntax unless there is an existing implementation, or unless specifically instructed to do so
- Avoid using `any` type as much as possible
- If there are import issues, ignore them temporarily and fix them by formatting when the task is completed
