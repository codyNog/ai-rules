## Markdown Writing Rules

This document outlines specific rules and preferences for writing Markdown in this project.

### General Readability

- Keep lines reasonably short (around 80-100 characters) for readability, where possible.

### Headings

- Use a single top-level heading (`#`) per document.
- Increment heading levels sequentially (e.g., `#` -> `##` -> `###`). Do not skip levels.

### Lists

- Use hyphens (`-`) for unordered lists.
- Ensure exactly one space follows the list marker (e.g., `- item`, not `-   item`).
- Indent list items consistently (use 2 or 4 spaces, be consistent within the document).
- Do not use bold formatting for the beginning of list items as pseudo-headings. If hierarchy is needed within a list item, consider using nested lists or restructuring.

### Code Blocks

- Always use fenced code blocks (```) and specify the language identifier (e.g., `javascript`, `bash`).

### Links and Images

- Use descriptive link text: `[Good Example Text](url)` instead of `[here](url)`.
- Always provide meaningful alt text for images: `![Descriptive alt text](image_url)`.
