# React Native

## Core Rules

- Use functional components with TypeScript
- Use StyleSheet.create() for styles, never inline styles
- Use FlatList for lists, not ScrollView with map
- Handle iOS/Android differences with Platform.select()
- Use React Navigation for navigation
- Type all props including navigation props
